#BensListAutos

## Synopsis

This is a tool to scan craigslist automotive "for sale" listings and store the data in a local database.  The information from the ads can then be validated and matched to a valid year, make and model so that we can more easily query the data.  This strategy results in an improved filtering of craigslist ads and centralizes the data from various local craigslist sites into a single database.  The only negative of this strategy is that craigslist has implemented a limit of requests per IP, so the scraping of live ads is currently only functional for 5-10k ads per day per IP.
